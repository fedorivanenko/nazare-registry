# Update Theme

## Goal

Add `nazare theme update` to safely fast-forward installed Nazare scaffold files from the configured registry without clobbering user edits.

Unmodified tracked files update. Modified tracked files stop the command before any mutation unless `--force` is passed. Obsolete unmodified tracked files may be deleted. Untracked files are never deleted. `--check` reports the plan without mutating files.

---

## Scope

Included:

- `nazare theme update`
- `nazare theme update --force`
- `nazare theme update --check`
- registry resolution from `nazare.config.yml`
- current manifest `theme` block validation using `theme-pull` rules, including per-file registry checksum metadata
- tracked-file safety checks using `nazare.lock.yml` checksum metadata
- update of unmodified tracked files
- deletion of obsolete unmodified tracked files
- copy of new manifest files only when target path is absent
- lockfile metadata updates after successful writes/deletes
- README instructions and Vitest coverage

### Checksum contract

Registry manifest `theme.files[]` entries are the checksum source of truth for registry content:

```yaml
theme:
  files:
    - from: theme/default/layout/theme.liquid
      to: layout/theme.liquid
      checksum:
        algorithm: sha256
        value: 3b7b7f1f4c8c0d36c9d6f2f3d1b2a1a0c9e8d7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e5f4
```

For every current manifest entry, update must compute SHA-256 for the resolved registry `from` file and verify it matches manifest `checksum.value` before planning writes. Missing, malformed, unsupported, or mismatched registry checksum metadata is invalid.

Each tracked theme file in `nazare.lock.yml` stores the last-installed verified registry checksum:

```yaml
theme:
  version: 1.0.0
  source: theme/default
  installedAt: "2026-05-25T00:00:00.000Z"
  updatedAt: "2026-05-26T00:00:00.000Z"
  files:
    - path: layout/theme.liquid
      source: theme/default/layout/theme.liquid
      checksum:
        algorithm: sha256
        value: 3b7b7f1f4c8c0d36c9d6f2f3d1b2a1a0c9e8d7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e5f4
```

Local state:

- unmodified: file exists and SHA-256 equals lockfile checksum
- modified: file exists and SHA-256 differs
- missing: file does not exist
- obsolete: tracked file no longer appears in current manifest by `path`/`source`
- untracked target: manifest target path absent from lockfile `theme.files`

Missing lockfile checksum metadata is migrated when it can be proven safe: if a current tracked local file equals the current verified registry content, update may add checksum metadata from the registry manifest without rewriting the file. If the local file differs, update must fail unless `--force` is passed. Missing obsolete lockfile checksum metadata may be untracked.

### Operation rules

- Current tracked file + unmodified + registry content changed -> overwrite and update checksum.
- Current tracked file + missing checksum + local equals registry -> add checksum metadata.
- Current tracked file + missing checksum + local differs from registry -> fail before mutation.
- Current tracked file + missing checksum + local differs from registry + `--force` -> overwrite and update checksum.
- Current tracked file + modified -> fail before mutation.
- Current tracked file + modified + `--force` -> overwrite and update checksum.
- Current tracked file + missing -> fail before mutation.
- Current tracked file + missing + `--force` -> restore from registry and update checksum.
- Obsolete tracked file + unmodified -> delete file and remove lockfile entry.
- Obsolete tracked file + modified -> fail before mutation.
- Obsolete tracked file + modified + `--force` -> delete file and remove lockfile entry.
- Obsolete tracked file + missing -> remove lockfile entry during successful update.
- New manifest target + absent locally -> copy and add lockfile entry.
- New manifest target + exists locally -> fail before mutation because ownership is ambiguous.
- New manifest target + exists locally + `--force` -> overwrite and add lockfile entry.
- Untracked local files -> never delete unless they are current manifest targets and `--force` is passed.

## Success behavior

- Resolves registry, reads current manifest, validates paths and registry checksum metadata, verifies registry file bytes against manifest checksums, and plans all operations before mutation.
- Writes changed unmodified tracked files with current registry content.
- Deletes obsolete unmodified tracked files.
- Copies new manifest files whose target paths are absent.
- No-op update exits `0`, prints no-op message, and leaves lockfile unchanged.
- Successful mutation prints written/deleted paths and exits `0`.
- `--check` exits `0` when update can proceed safely, prints planned writes/deletes/no-op, and does not mutate files or lockfile.
- `--check` exits non-zero for the same safety errors as normal update and does not mutate files or lockfile.
- `--force` may overwrite modified current files, restore missing current files, delete modified obsolete files, and overwrite existing untracked manifest targets.

After successful mutation:

- `theme.version` and `theme.source` come from current manifest.
- `theme.installedAt` is preserved when present.
- `theme.updatedAt` is set to update time as RFC 3339 timestamp.
- written/new files have `path`, `source`, and `checksum` copied from the verified current registry manifest entry.
- obsolete deleted/already-missing files are removed from `theme.files`.
- component lockfile data is unchanged.

---

## Failure behavior

Before any mutation, exit non-zero with clear error when:

- repo lacks `nazare.config.yml` or `nazare.lock.yml`
- lockfile lacks `theme` metadata
- config, lockfile, registry origin, manifest, manifest `theme` block, version, source, files, or checksum metadata are invalid
- any manifest `from`/`to` path is unsafe, duplicate, or missing in registry snapshot
- any manifest checksum does not match resolved registry file content
- any tracked entry lacks lockfile checksum metadata and cannot be safely migrated
- any current tracked installed file is modified or missing, unless `--force` is passed
- any obsolete tracked file is modified, unless `--force` is passed
- any new manifest target exists locally but is untracked, unless `--force` is passed

Failed update must not mutate theme files, component lockfile entries, or files outside current/previously tracked `theme.files` destinations.

  - Verify clear metadata error and lockfile unchanged.
- [ ] new manifest file copies when target absent
  - Verify file created and lockfile entry has checksum.

- [ ] `--check` reports planned operations without mutation
  - Verify files and lockfile unchanged for write/delete plan.
- [ ] `--check` reports safety errors without mutation
  - Verify non-zero exit and unchanged files/lockfile.
- [ ] successful update preserves `theme.installedAt` and sets `theme.updatedAt`
- [ ] untracked files are never deleted

## Architecture notes

Reuse `theme-pull` primitives for config, lockfile, registry, manifest, and safe path validation.

Plan phases:

1. Validate config, lockfile, manifest, checksum metadata, and all paths.
2. Verify all current manifest checksums against resolved registry file bytes.
3. Classify tracked files by lockfile checksum and current manifest membership.
4. Build full operation plan: writes, deletes, new copies, lockfile changes.
5. Execute file operations only after full plan is safe.
6. Update lockfile only after file operations finish.

Checksum metadata is the local-modification authority. Do not compare local files to current registry to detect edits; registry may have changed. Do not attempt three-way merge.

`--force` is explicit confirmation for destructive overwrite/delete behavior. It still must not affect paths outside current manifest targets or previously tracked theme files.

`--check` uses the same planner as update, but stops before mutation and reports the plan.
